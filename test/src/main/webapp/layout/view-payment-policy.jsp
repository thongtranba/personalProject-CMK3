		<span>CARD PAYMENT </span>
	</p>
	<p>You can pay with credit or debit cards from VISA, Mastercard and
		American Express at website. Your card transaction is sent encrypted
		through Klarna, which is our provider of card payment solutions. When
		paying by card, the card number, the card's validity period, CVC code
		and, for some cards, also the 3D Secure code are entered. Card
		information is not stored by BT Shop after a completed transaction.
		The total amount of your order is reserved only in your account and we
		debit your account only when we ship your order. We only charge you
		for products we ship to you.</p>
	<p>
		<span>IF YOU CANNOT COMPLETE THE PAYMENT BY CARD</span>
	</p>
	<p>The following may be the reason why you cannot complete your
		order and sign with 3Dsecure/BankID:</p>
	<p>- Signing with 3D Secure/BankID usually requires Java to work on
		the device. If you do not have Java installed, you will get a white
		page without being able to complete your purchase.</p>
	<p>- You are using a device that does not support Java. Please try
		to complete your purchase from another device.</p>
	<p>- Also check that you have activated the option for online
		purchases with your card before paying.</p>
