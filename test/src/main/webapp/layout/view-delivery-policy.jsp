			<b>DELIVERY TIME</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Many of you shop with us now and we work day
					and night to pack and send all your packages on time. Despite that,
					there may be delays in our delivery to you, up to 2-4 days more
					than you intended.</span><span><br /> <br /></span></li>
			<li><span>Once we have confirmed your order, an order
					confirmation will be sent to your provided email address. Contact
					our customer service if you do not receive a confirmation shortly
					after your order. The delivery time (including the forwarder's time
					to deliver your order) normally takes no more than 1-7 days
					nationwide when we send your order to the nearest delivery point.
					It may occasionally take a few extra days during major campaigns
					and department store openings. You can trust that we will do
					everything we can to deliver your order as quickly as possible!</span></li>
		</ul>

			<b>SOLD OUT ITEMS IN YOUR ORDER</b>

			<li><span> Sometimes, unfortunately, you can order goods
					that for one reason or another (incorrect stock status) are not
					available in our central warehouse or on our internet warehouse.
					You will then of course receive notification from us via e-mail. </span></li>
		</ul>
